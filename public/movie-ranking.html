<h1>The Best Movies According to James</h1>

<h2>My Top Three of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>I became facinated at how one man can bring terror upon opposition army.</p>

<p>Who but achilles could bring legions armies<br />
to their knees at the idea that he would appear<br />
with a swift swing of his sword</p>

<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>It opened my eyes to thinking outside the box.</p>
<h3>Alexander</h3>
<p>Amazed at the infulence Alexander had on his soldiers. </p>
